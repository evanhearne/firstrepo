# Hello, and welcome to my new README.md! 
# As this is my first repository, I am a little unexperienced. 
# Well, it's my first repository using the command line to do EVERYTHING.
# Well, as the French say 'C'est la vie!'.
# I will add more to this when I need to. But for now, I am only learning how to use the command line efficiently.
# -Evan
